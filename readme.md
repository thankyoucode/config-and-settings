# Config and Settings

This is a collection of my personal setup files for tools I use every day like VSCode, Bash, and Zsh.

I made these files to help set up my computer faster and keep things the same on all my devices. You can use them too if you want.

## What is inside?

- Settings for VSCode to make coding easier and nicer.
- Bash and Zsh files to customize the terminal with shortcuts and themes.
- Vim settings to improve text editing.

## How to use?

Copy the files you need to the right place on your computer. For example, copy Bash files to your home folder or VSCode settings to the config folder. Then restart the program, and it will use these settings.

Feel free to change the files to fit your style.

## Why share?

I want to help others save time setting up their tools. If you find these useful, thatâ€™s great! Also, you can suggest changes or improvements.

Thanks for visiting!
